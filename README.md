Let's take an example for better understanding of the code
Our test case is: "P>E","E>R","R>U" 
and we are making word according to the given logic in the function:
PERU is our answer.

for the solution of the problem:
We have taken two maps
(1) first map to store the next character value corresponding to particular value.
(2) second map we are storing the integer values for the corresponding existing values in first map.
We will consider it a character as a part of our result if the corresponding value of that particular character in the second map is 0.
Or we are getting a series of characters starting from a particular starting point of the string.
